This lab aims to enhance understanding of Stack and Stack Frame concepts while navigating and analyzing binary executables using OllyDbg.
Participants will delve into the role of function calls, parameters, and return values in software functionality, developing strategies for binary modification without introducing errors or instability.
Inspired by beginner-friendly reverse engineering tutorials, this lab offers hands-on experience with binary manipulation, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with practical skills in a controlled environment.
By engaging in this exercise, learners gain insights into software internals, demystifying executable file mechanics and acquiring problem-solving tools crucial for cybersecurity.
