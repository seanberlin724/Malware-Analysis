The primary goal of this lab is to comprehend the functioning of antivirus systems and the principle behind heuristic detection.
Participants will delve into dynamic heuristic analysis, a method aimed at identifying new and obfuscated viruses by scrutinizing their behavior within a virtual environment.
The objective entails developing a heuristic dynamic analysis tool tailored specifically for detecting unknown ransomware.
Through a series of steps outlined in the lab, participants will generate a log file capturing the activities of a ransomware sample executed in a controlled environment. Subsequently, they will analyze the log file and implement heuristic rules to determine the maliciousness of the observed activities.
The final output of the program should indicate whether the analyzed behavior aligns with the criteria for identifying ransomware, thereby enhancing understanding of heuristic detection methodologies.
