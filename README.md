# Malware-Analysis
The Malware Analysis course repository encapsulates a comprehensive journey through various aspects of analyzing and understanding malicious software.
From understanding DLL Injection and Stack Frame concepts to developing heuristic malware detection systems and analyzing kernel-mode rootkits, each lab offers hands-on experience with essential tools like OllyDbg, WinDBG, and Python.
The final project, focusing on the analysis of the notorious Zeus Trojan malware, represents the culmination of skills acquired throughout the course, including memory analysis with the Volatility framework and source code examination.
By navigating these challenges, I gained invaluable insights into malware behavior, detection methodologies, and preventative strategies, preparing them to tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges effectively.
This portfolio serves as a testament to the expertise gained and the dedication to safeguarding digital environments against evolving cyber threats.
