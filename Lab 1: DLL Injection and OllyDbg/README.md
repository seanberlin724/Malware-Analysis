This lab focuses on understanding DLL Injection concepts and utilizing OllyDbg to modify binary files.
Participants will aim to change the debug information in the DebugView window from "Injection!!! – CSC 497/583 – Si Chen" to "Hello World! – [Your Name]".
The experiment setup involves downloading and installing VirtualBox, booting up a Windows XP virtual machine, and downloading the provided hack dll.zip file.
Participants will unzip the file, open myhack.dll using Ollydbg, and follow instructions to modify the debug string and launch a DLL Injection attack with the modified DLL file.
