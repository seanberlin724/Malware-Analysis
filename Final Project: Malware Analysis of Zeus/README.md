The final project for this course involves analyzing the notorious Trojan malware, Zeus.
Using the provided memory dump file (zeus.vmem), students will conduct an in-depth analysis with the Volatility framework, akin to the techniques covered in class.
Subsequently, leveraging the leaked source code of the malware, participants will substantiate their analysis.
Each student must submit a comprehensive malware analysis report in PDF formatL.
The report should clearly delineate task division among team members.
It must incorporate textual explanations and figures, ensuring original content creation without recycling screenshots from other sources.
A malware analysis report serves to provide a thorough breakdown of the functionality and risks associated with a cyber threat.
The report should encompass the following sections:
Introduction: A succinct overview of the malware.
Findings: Detailed description of the malware's intended activities, elucidated through:
Utilization of Volatility to scrutinize the memory dump and identify relevant artifacts (e.g., API Hooks of Zeus).
Reference to the leaked malware source code to substantiate identified activities (e.g., pinpointing responsible functions/lines of code).
Summary: Conclusive summary of findings along with recommendations for infection prevention and recovery strategies.
