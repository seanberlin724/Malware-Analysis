This lab aims to deepen understanding of Import Address Table (IAT) and Export Address Table (EAT) concepts while using static analysis to detect malware.
Participants are tasked with creating a runnable program in Python to scan a folder and analyze the Portable Executable (PE) structure of malware samples provided in malware.zip.
The program should implement heuristic rules to identify potential malware based on characteristics observed in the PE structure.
Participants are encouraged to explore the provided malware samples and apply the heuristic rules to identify potential malicious behavior.
This exercise offers practical experience in malware analysis and reinforces an understanding of PE structure analysis techniques.
