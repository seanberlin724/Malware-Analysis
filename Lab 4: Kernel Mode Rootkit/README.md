This lab focuses on Kernel Mode Rootkit concepts and utilizes WinDBG with VirtualBox for Windows kernel debugging.
Participants will set up kernel-mode debugging manually using a Virtual COM Port, enabling them to analyze debug information outputted by WinDBG.
Lab questions prompt participants to define SSDT, execute WinDBG commands, and analyze the behavior of SSDT hook malware.
By engaging in hands-on experimentation and analysis, participants will gain practical insights into kernel-level debugging techniques and rootkit detection methods.
This experience enhances understanding of system internals and strengthens skills in malware analysis and detection
